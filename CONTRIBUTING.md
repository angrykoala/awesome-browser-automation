Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

* Use the following format: `[tool|resource](link) - Description.`
* Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
* Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
* Additions should be added in alphabetical order of the relevant category.
* New categories, or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome.
* Keep descriptions short and simple, but descriptive.
* Start the description with a capital and end with a full stop/period.

## Software/Tools
* Additions of your own tools or resources are welcome, as long as they are awesome, documented, and functional.

* While not strictly required, software that is currently maintained is preferable.
* If a tool is not a browser automation tool, but it is somehow related to browser automation and testing, please add it under **related tools**
* If a tool is a plugin, or depends on another tool, please add it as a sublist under the mentioned tool using the same format as other items in the list.
